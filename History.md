Changes
================

HEAD
---------

* Can now pass a [connection\_pool](https://github.com/mperham/connection_pool) in as a Redis instance or a pool
  to be processed faster.

0.9.3
---------

* Fix runtime error introduced in last release when running in Rails development environment

0.9.2

  instead.
* Add support for Batch operations, providing an easy way to fan out
  operations and then collect results when completed.
